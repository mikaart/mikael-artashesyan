Welcome to new series of Blogs. **Here** is a quick summary of things I've learned this week.

## Github is a friend

Remember kids, do not try to work on a joint project without a way to quickly seeing what are the updates other person did. Don't be me througout the 3 month direction of my internship. Do not send emails to your project co-partner every other day with the same file you've been working on but with minor upgrades to it. 

Basically, find a tutorial on how to make quick uploads to your Github through Visual Studio, share that repo with your co-partner and enjoy doing commits on daily basis while tracking the changes other person did. This brings better metrics in the picture and most importantly saves a ton of time. If it is something you do often, there is no excuse to go through this process once.
