# Blog 2

Welcome to new series of Blogs. **Here** is a quick summary of things I've learned this week.

## Docker

While being familiar with concept of docker, it is interesting to see it in action. The beauty of it that it allows to contain servers in a very scalable way decreasing resource usage and setup times drastically compared to classic VM virtualization technology. There is no hypervisor needed and that makes the technology so lightweight. [Here](https://cloudacademy.com/blog/docker-vs-virtual-machines-differences-you-should-know/) is an article that gave me a better inside on differences in these. 

While setting up a container for a project, I noticed how it has the ability to pull operating system from its cloud library, eliminating stress associated with getting a right version you may need from repo source. Count this as a plus for me, as it is something I came across struggling with throughout the years.

The lab itself provided a good knowledge base on setting docker containers and good ol' Ubuntu troubleshooting. This time I was getting an error regarding **Composer** installation, the answer to which was one of php modules that was not included in the Lab instruction. Luckily, internet saves us as always.
