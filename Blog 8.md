# Blog 8

Welcome to new series of Blogs. **Here** is a quick summary of things I've learned this week.

## Ansible and Dockerfile

I learned that both Ansible and Dockerfile serve a great business for developers and testers as an easy way to create lightweight images for whatever reasons given. While the commands differ with each having different names of doing the same thing, I enjoed creating Ansible playbook a bit more than I did Dockerfile mainly because some of the commands to execute using dockerfile are harder to do than using Ansible. For example, when overwriting an existing file in Ansible you are able to specify what line and in what context you want the overriding to take place. I have not done the same with Dockerfile as it seemed to me at the moment that it was more confusing and lengthy than the other. 

### Ansible

Ansibleâ€™s definition tells us that it is an opensource tool for IT configuration management, deployment, and orchestration. The applications of Ansible can help in gettng insights about their benefits for DevOps. The different applications of Ansible include provisioning, configuration management, deploying applications, security and compliance, and orchestration. It seemed to me that Ansible is much simplier to learn than Dockerfile. The logic and commands are more simplistic and the documentation they give is much easier to interpret and go through. Playbooks are Ansible configuration files, and the language for writing them is YAML.
